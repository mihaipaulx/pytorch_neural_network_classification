## Linear Regression Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of Linear Regression, demonstrating the principles, computations, and evaluation metrics for a regression model. The notebook showcases the process of building a regression model, calculating loss, and interpreting results.

## Features

Implements Linear Regression using PyTorch.

Demonstrates loss calculation and its interpretation, with a specific focus on minimal loss values (e.g., 10^-6).

Provides an understanding of model accuracy and goodness-of-fit metrics like $R^2$.

Visualizes data and regression results with plots for better interpretability.

## Files

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
  - numpy

  - pandas

  - matplotlib

  - torch

  - jupyter

For torch, it is recommended to follow the installation instructions from the PyTorch official website.
